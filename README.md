<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Tonic Validate is a framework for the evaluation of LLM outputs, such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. Validate makes it easy to evaluate, track, and monitor your LLM and RAG applications. Validate allows you to evaluate your LLM outputs through the use of our provided metrics which measure everything from answer correctness to LLM hallucination. Additionally, Validate has an optional UI to visualize your evaluation results for easy tracking and monitoring.


## Preparing Data for RAG
The foundation of a high-performing RAG systems is quality, secure data. High-quality data ensures that the information retrieved and generated is accurate, relevant, and reliable, which enhances the system's overall performance and user trust. Security, on the other hand, protects this valuable data from breaches, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential and tamper-proof. Together, they form the bedrock of a robust RAG system, facilitating efficient, trustworthy retrieval and generation.

We are excited to introduce Tonic Textual, a powerful companion to Tonic Validate that can help improve your RAG system's performance. We created Tonic Textual to simplify and augment the data pre-processing for RAG systems. In just a few minutes, you can build automated unstructured data pipelines that extract text from unstructured data, detect and de-identify sensitive information, and transform the data into a format optimized for RAG systems. We also enrich your data with document metadata and contextual entity tags to build semantic entity graphs that ground your RAG system in truth, preventing hallucinations and improving the overall quality of the generated outputs.

You can learn more and try the tool completely free [here](<https://www.tonic.ai/textual?utm_campaign=Validate Referral&utm_source=Validate Referral>). We'd love to hear what you think!

<!-- Quick Start -->
## Quick Start

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

1. Install Tonic Validate
   ```
   pip install tonic-validate
   ```
   
  
2. Use the following code snippet to get started.

    ```python
    from tonic_validate import ValidateScorer, Benchmark
    import os

    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-openai-key"

    # Function to simulate getting a response and context from your LLM
    # Replace this with your actual function call
    def get_llm_response(question):
        return {
            "llm_answer": "Paris",
            "llm_context_list": ["Paris is the capital of France."]
        }

    benchmark = Benchmark(questions=["What is the capital of France?"], answers=["Paris"])
    # Score the responses for each question and answer pair
    scorer = ValidateScorer()
    run = scorer.score(benchmark, get_llm_response)
    ```

This code snippet, creates a benchmark with one question and reference answer and then scores the answer.  Providing a reference answer is not required for most metrics (see below Metrics table).

<!-- CI/CD -->
## CI/CD

Many users find value in running evaluations during the code review/pull request process.  You can create your own automation here using the snippet above and knowledge found in our documentation and this readme OR you can take advantage of our absolutely free Github Action in the Github Marketplace.  The listing is [here](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/tonic-validate-for-prs).  It's easy to setup but if you have any questions, just create an issue in the corresponding repository.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### Tonic Validate Metrics
Metrics are used to score your LLM's performance.  Validate ships with many different metrics which are applicable to most RAG systems.  You can create your own metrics as well by providing your own implementation of [metric.py](https://github.com/TonicAI/tonic_validate/blob/main/tonic_validate/metrics/metric.py).  To compute a metric, you must provide it data from your RAG application.  The table below shows a few of the many metrics we offer with Tonic Validate.  For more detail explanations of our metrics refer to our [documentation](https://docs.tonic.ai/validate/about-rag-metrics/tonic-validate-rag-metrics-reference).

| Metric Name                                                                                                                                                                                   | Inputs                                              | Score Range | What does it measure?                                                               |

### Metric Inputs
Metric inputs in Tonic Validate are used to provide the metrics with the information they need to calculate performance. Below, we explain each input type and how to pass them into Tonic Validate's SDK.

#### **Question**
**What is it**: The question asked  
**How to use**: You can provide the questions by passing them into the `Benchmark` via the `questions` argument.  
```python
from tonic_validate import Benchmark
benchmark = Benchmark(
    questions=["What is the capital of France?", "What is the capital of Germany?"]
)
```

#### **Reference Answer**
**What is it**: A prewritten answer that serves as the ground truth for how the RAG application should answer the question.  
**How to use**: You can provide the reference answers by passing it into the `Benchmark` via the `answers` argument. Each reference answer must correspond to a given question. So if the reference answer is for the third question in the `questions` list, then the reference answer must also be the third item in the `answers` list.  The only metric that requires a reference answer is the Answer Similarity Score
```python
from tonic_validate import Benchmark
benchmark = Benchmark(
    questions=["What is the capital of France?", "What is the capital of Germany?"]
    answers=["Paris", "Berlin"]
)
```

#### **LLM Answer**
**What is it**: The answer the RAG application / LLM gives to the question.  
**How to use**: You can provide the LLM answer via the callback you provide to the Validate scorer. The answer is the first item in the tuple response. 
```python
# Function to simulate getting a response and context from your LLM
# Replace this with your actual function call
def get_rag_response(question):
    return {
        "llm_answer": "Paris",
        "llm_context_list": ["Paris is the capital of France."]
    }

# Score the responses
scorer = ValidateScorer()
run = scorer.score(benchmark, ask_rag)
```
If you are manually logging the answers without using the callback, then you can provide the LLM answer via `llm_answer` when creating the `LLMResponse`.  
```python
from tonic_validate import LLMResponse
# Save the responses into an array for scoring
responses = []
for item in benchmark:
    # llm_answer is the answer that LLM gives
    llm_response = LLMResponse(
        llm_answer="Paris",
        benchmark_item=item
    )
    responses.append(llm_response)

# Score the responses
scorer = ValidateScorer()
run = scorer.score_responses(responses)
```


#### **Retrieved Context**
**What is it**: The context that your RAG application retrieves when answering a given question. This context is what's put in the prompt by the RAG application to help the LLM answer the question.  
**How to use**: You can provide the LLM's retrieved context list via the callback you provide to the Validate scorer. The answer is the second item in the tuple response. The retrieved context is always a list
```python
# Function to simulate getting a response and context from your LLM
# Replace this with your actual function call
def get_rag_response(question):
    return {
        "llm_answer": "Paris",
        "llm_context_list": ["Paris is the capital of France."]
    }

# Score the responses
scorer = ValidateScorer()
run = scorer.score(benchmark, ask_rag)
```
If you are manually logging the answers, then you can provide the LLM context via `llm_context_list` when creating the `LLMResponse`.  
```python
from tonic_validate import LLMResponse
# Save the responses into an array for scoring
responses = []
for item in benchmark:
    # llm_answer is the answer that LLM gives
    # llm_context_list is a list of the context that the LLM used to answer the question
    llm_response = LLMResponse(
        llm_answer="Paris",
        llm_context_list=["Paris is the capital of France."],
        benchmark_item=item
    )
    responses.append(llm_response)

# Score the responses
scorer = ValidateScorer()
run = scorer.score_responses(responses)
```

#### **Run Time**
**What is it**: Used for the latency metric to measure how long it took the LLM to respond.  
**How to use**: If you are using the Validate scorer callback, then this metric is automatically calculated for you. If you are manually creating the LLM responses, then you need to provide how long the LLM took yourself via the `run_time` argument.
```python
from tonic_validate import LLMResponse

# Save the responses into an array for scoring
responses = []
for item in benchmark:
    run_time = # Float representing how many seconds the LLM took to respond
    # llm_answer is the answer that LLM gives
    # llm_context_list is a list of the context that the LLM used to answer the question
    llm_response = LLMResponse(
        llm_answer="Paris",
        llm_context_list=["Paris is the capital of France."],
        benchmark_item=item
        run_time=run_time
    )
    responses.append(llm_response)

# Score the responses
scorer = ValidateScorer()
run = scorer.score_responses(responses)
```

### Scoring With Metrics

Most metrics are scored with the assistance of a LLM.  Validate supports OpenAI and Azure OpenAI but other LLMs can easily be integrated (just file an github issue against this repository).

#### **Important**: Setting up OpenAI Key for Scoring
In order to use OpenAI you must provide an OpenAI API Key.
```python
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "put-your-openai-api-key-here"
```
If you already have the `OPENAI_API_KEY` set in your system's environment variables then you can skip this step. Otherwise, please set the environment variable before proceeding.

##### Using Azure
If you are using Azure, instead of setting the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable, you instead need to set `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` and `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`. `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` is the endpoint url for your Azure OpenAI deployment and `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` is your API key.
```python
import os
os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "put-your-azure-openai-api-key-here"
os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"] = "put-your-azure-endpoint-here"
```

#### Using Gemini
If you already have the `GEMINI_API_KEY` set in your system's environment variables then you can skip this step. Otherwise, please set the environment variable before proceeding.
```python
import os
os.environ["GEMINI_API_KEY"] = "put-your-gemini-api-key-here"
```
_Note that to use gemini, your Python version must be 3.9 or higher._

#### Using Claude
If you already have the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set in your system's environment variables then you can skip this step. Otherwise, please set the environment variable before proceeding.
```python
import os
os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = "put-your-anthropic-api-key-here"
```

#### Using Mistral
If you already have the `MISTRAL_API_KEY` set in your system's environment variables then you can skip this step. Otherwise, please set the environment variable before proceeding.
```python
import os
os.environ["MISTRAL_API_KEY"] = "put-your-mistral-api-key-here"
```

#### Using Cohere
If you already have the `COHERE_API_KEY` set in your system's environment variables then you can skip this step. Otherwise, please set the environment variable before proceeding.
```python
import os
os.environ["COHERE_API_KEY"] = "put-your-cohere-api-key-here"
```

#### Using Together AI
If you already have the `TOGETHERAI_API_KEY` set in your system's environment variables then you can skip this step. Otherwise, please set the environment variable before proceeding.
```python
import os
os.environ["TOGETHERAI_API_KEY"] = "put-your-togetherai-api-key-here"
```

#### Using AWS Bedrock or AWS Sagemaker
If you already have the `"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `AWS_REGION_NAME` set in your system's environment variables then you can skip this step. Otherwise, please set the environment variables before proceeding.
```python
import os
os.environ["AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"]="put-your-aws-access-key-id-here"
os.environ["AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"]="put-your-aws-secret-access-key-here"
os.environ["AWS_REGION_NAME"]="put-your-aws-region-name-here"
```


#### Setting up the Tonic Validate Scorer
To use metrics, instantiate an instance of ValidateScorer.
```python
from tonic_validate import ValidateScorer
scorer = ValidateScorer()
```

The default model used for scoring metrics is GPT 4 Turbo. To change the OpenAI model, pass the OpenAI model name into the `model_evaluator` argument for `ValidateScorer`. You can also pass in custom metrics via an array of metrics.

```python
from tonic_validate import ValidateScorer
from tonic_validate.metrics import AnswerConsistencyMetric, AnswerSimilarityMetric

scorer = ValidateScorer([
    AnswerConsistencyMetric(),
    AugmentationAccuracyMetric()
], model_evaluator="gpt-3.5-turbo")
```

You can also pass in other models like Google Gemini, Claude, Mistral, Cohere, Together AI, and AWS Bedrock by setting the `model_evaluator` argument to the model name like so
```python
scorer = ValidateScorer(model_evaluator="gemini/gemini-1.5-pro-latest")
```
```python
scorer = ValidateScorer(model_evaluator="claude-3")
```
```python
scorer = ValidateScorer(model_evaluator="mistral/mistral-tiny")
```
```python
scorer = ValidateScorer(model_evaluator="command-r")
```
```python
scorer = ValidateScorer(model_evaluator="together_ai/togethercomputer/Llama-2-7B-32K-Instruct")
```
```python
scorer = ValidateScorer(model_evaluator="bedrock/your-bedrock-model")
```
If an error occurs while scoring an item's metric, the score for that metric will be set to `None`. If you instead wish to have Tonic Validate throw an exception when there's an error scoring, then set `fail_on_error` to `True` in the constructor

```python
scorer = ValidateScorer(fail_on_error=True)
```

#### **Important**: Using the scorer on Azure
If you are using Azure, you MUST set the `model_evaluator` argument to your deployment name like so
```python
scorer = ValidateScorer(model_evaluator="your-deployment-name")
```

#### **Important**: Using the scorer on AWS Sagemaker
If you are using AWS Bedrock, you MUST set the `model_evaluator` argument to your endpoint name and the `model_id` argument to your model name like so
```python
scorer = ValidateScorer(model_evaluator="your-endpoint-name", model_id="your-model-name")
```

#### Running the Scorer
After you instantiate the `ValidateScorer` with your desired metrics, you can then score the metrics using the callback you defined earlier.

```python
from tonic_validate import ValidateScorer, ValidateApi

# Function to simulate getting a response and context from your LLM
# Replace this with your actual function call
def get_rag_response(question):
    return {
        "llm_answer": "Paris",
        "llm_context_list": ["Paris is the capital of France."]
    }

# Score the responses
scorer = ValidateScorer()
run = scorer.score(benchmark, ask_rag)
```

##### Running the Scorer with manual logging
If you don't want to use the callback, you can instead log your answers manually by iterating over the benchmark and then score the answers.
```python
from tonic_validate import ValidateScorer, LLMResponse

# Save the responses into an array for scoring
responses = []
for item in benchmark:
    llm_response = LLMResponse(
        llm_answer="Paris",
        llm_context_list=["Paris is the capital of France"],
        benchmark_item=item
    )
    responses.append(llm_response)

# Score the responses
scorer = ValidateScorer()
run = scorer.score_responses(responses)
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>



### Viewing the Results

You can manually print out the results via python like so
```python
print("Overall Scores")
print(run.overall_scores)
print("------")
for item in run.run_data:
    print("Question: ", item.reference_question)
    print("Answer: ", item.reference_answer)
    print("LLM Answer: ", item.llm_answer)
    print("LLM Context: ", item.llm_context)
    print("Scores: ", item.scores)
    print("------")
```
which outputs the following
```
Overall Scores
{'answer_consistency': 1.0, 'augmentation_accuracy': 1.0}
------
Question:  What is the capital of France?
Answer:  Paris
LLM Answer:  Paris
LLM Context:  ['Paris is the capital of France.']
Scores:  {'answer_consistency': 1.0, 'augmentation_accuracy': 1.0}
------
Question:  What is the capital of Spain?
Answer:  Madrid
LLM Answer:  Paris
LLM Context:  ['Paris is the capital of France.']
Scores:  {'answer_consistency': 1.0, 'augmentation_accuracy': 1.0}
------
```

### Telemetry
Tonic Validate collects minimal telemetry to help us figure out what users want and how they're using the product. Only the following information is tracked regarding usage of the product.  (Additional information is collected below, see details).

* What metrics were used for a run
* Number of questions in a run
* Time taken for a run to be evaluated
* Number of questions in a benchmark
* SDK Version being used

We do **NOT** track things such as the contents of the questions / answers, your scores, or any other sensitive information. For detecting CI/CD, we only check for common environment variables in different CI/CD environments. We do not log the values of these environment variables.

We also generate a random UUID to help us figure out how many users are using the product. This UUID is linked to your Validate account only to help track who is using the SDK and UI at once and to get user counts. 

We also collect information on version of python being used and characteristics of the machine (e.g. calls to `platform.system()` and `platform.machine()`).  This information is sent to Scarf which helps us better understand our open-source community.

If you wish to opt out of telemetry, you only need to set the `TONIC_VALIDATE_DO_NOT_TRACK` environment variable to `True`. If you want to see how we implemented telemetry, you can do so in the `tonic_validate/utils/telemetry.py` file.

## FAQ

#### What models can I use an LLM evaluator?

We currently allow the family of chat completion models from Open AI, Google, Anthropic, and more.  We are always looking to add more models to our evaluator.  If you have a model you would like to see added, please file an issue against this repository.

We'd like to add more models as choices for the LLM evaluator without adding to the complexity of the package too much.

The default model used for scoring metrics is GPT 4 Turbo. To change the model, pass the model name into the `model` argument for `ValidateScorer`

```python
scorer = ValidateScorer([
    AnswerConsistencyMetric(),
    AugmentationAccuracyMetric()
], model_evaluator="gpt-3.5-turbo")
```
