    "quote": "The second reason it's dangerous to ban the discussion of ideas is that ideas are more closely related than they look. Which means if you restrict the discussion of some topics, it doesn't only affect those topics. The restrictions propagate back into any topic that yields implications in the forbidden ones."

    "question": "Why do some people believe that wealth should be distributed equally?",

    "question": "What factors contributed to Silicon Valley and Seattle becoming major tech centers?",
    "answer": "Silicon Valley became a tech center because William Shockley wanted to move back to Palo Alto and the experts he lured west liked it so much they stayed, while Seattle became a tech center because Gates and Allen wanted to move back home.",
    "quote": "Silicon Valley is where it is because William Shockley wanted to move back to Palo Alto, where he grew up, and the experts he lured west to work with him liked it so much they stayed.

    "essay": "revolution.txt",
    "question": "Why do startups not spread as quickly and widely as industrialization did historically?",
    "answer": "Startups do not spread as efficiently because they are more of a social phenomenon and don't rely on geography, needing a community of expertise, unlike how individual European manufacturers could import industrial techniques and they would work fine.",
    "quote": "Startups don't seem to spread so well, partly because they're more a social than a technical phenomenon, and partly because they're not tied to geography. An individual European manufacturer could import industrial techniques and they'd work fine. This doesn't seem to work so well with startups: you need a community of expertise, as you do in the movie business."
